GPTFuzz Attack - Technical Explanation

Overview
GPTFuzz is a black-box jailbreak attack that uses fuzzing techniques to automatically generate adversarial prompts. It systematically explores the prompt space to find variations that can bypass safety mechanisms in language models.

How the Attack Works

1. Prompt Fuzzing
The attack takes input prompts and applies fuzzing transformations to generate variations. These transformations include mutations, paraphrasing, and structural modifications that preserve the core intent while changing the surface form.

2. Model Evaluation
Each generated prompt variation is sent to the target model to evaluate whether it bypasses safety guardrails. The model's response is analyzed to determine if the attack was successful.

3. Iterative Refinement
The fuzzer uses feedback from previous attempts to guide the generation of new prompt variations. Successful mutations are refined further to improve the attack effectiveness.

4. Black-box Nature
GPTFuzz operates without access to the model's internal parameters or gradients. It only relies on the model's output, making it applicable to any language model accessible via API.

Key Features
- No gradient information required
- Works on any API-accessible language model
- Systematic exploration of prompt space
- Efficient fuzzing-based approach
- Automatic variation generation

Execution
The attack is run using the gptfuzz.py file which implements the fuzzing logic and orchestrates the attack process against target models.
